**A)** The value of `sum(approxMass)` is `r sum(approxMass)`. This is less than 1 because it is not using the analytical solution - instead, this is a numerical approximation of the beta distribution.  

**B)** We cannot use theta on the interval from 0 to 1.  We must use the midpoints.  Using 0 and 1 as endpoints gives an incorrect numerical approximation.  While the widths are the same as the other rectangles, the edges actually extend outside of the beta distribution, giving an over-approximation of the area.  Indeed, using such a parameterization, we see a total probability estimate of **insert new estimate here**
