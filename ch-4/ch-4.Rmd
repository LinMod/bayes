####Ex 4-1

Estimate the true probability of having a disease, given that you tested positive.
```{r disease1, echo=TRUE}

D <-1/1000 # Probability of disease
TD <- 0.99
T_not_D <- 0.05

post <- (TD*D)/(TD*D + T_not_D*(1-D))
```

The probability that you have the disease, given that you test positive, is `r post`. Now, we perform the same procedure, but this time, the prior distribution is the posterior from our previous calculation.

```{r disease2, echo=FALSE}
post2 <- ((1-TD)*post)/((1-TD)*post + (1-T_not_D)*(1-post))
```

Now, given that you tested negative, the probability that you have the disease is `r post2`. Chances are pretty good you don't have anything!
